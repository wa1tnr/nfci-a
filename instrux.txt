Instructions

cd to the lastest version.

  nfci-ad is the latest version at the moment (see timestamp, above).

Compile and upload in Arduino IDE
(current target: Adafruit Circuit Playground Express, NeoPixels on D8).

Connect to target USB port (in linux, this is /dev/ttyACM0).

Stuff will happen on its own.

Any keystroke except for 'b' (just one letter, b) will simply echo.

A keystroke of 'b' halts the changing color routine
(latches it, freezing the color hue where it was at the moment
the key was pressed).


That's all that's going on.  Soon, provision will be made for a
trap of keystroke 'c' as well, but that's not done yet.
